# PST-CTF
Some code tidbits from pst's ctf. These are codebits that are pulled from the SLEDE 8 challanges that were posted by PST. It is a knock of x86 assembly. The modulo challange was about adding numbers and calculating the modulo to that. The second challange was much harder, as you had to add number together and calculate the sum without modulo, but the registers only allowed numbers up to fifteen, so any number above fifteen would originally be represented as the number modulo 16. So in order to convert from binary to decimal system AND having the numbers appear as ascii code using assembly i had to implement a version of a base conversion algorithm and use some of the unused registers as additional memory.
